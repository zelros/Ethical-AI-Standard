# An Open Standard for Ethical Enterprise-Grade AI
This is the result of our thoughts, at Zelros, to define an **open standard for a transparent use of machine learning algorithms in enterprises**.

You can find: 
- the initial story behind this standard [in this blog post](https://medium.com/@Zelros/an-open-standard-for-ethical-enterprise-grade-ai-b21bc5908b73)
- the explanation of the latest update [in this second blog post](https://www.zelros.com/2021/02/15/announcing-the-latest-version-of-zelros-open-standard-for-a-more-responsible-ai/)

## What is this standard about?
The standard we propose takes the form of a 'check-list', that every machine learning model embedded in a product or a service should document. We believe that filling this standard document for each AI model in production contributes to their **traceability, compliance and transparency**.
The original standard has seven sections, explained [in the blog post](https://medium.com/@Zelros/an-open-standard-for-ethical-enterprise-grade-ai-b21bc5908b73).
NB: The new versions involve changes in the original sections.

## Why publishing this standard on github?
We decided to publish this standard publicly on our github, because we know that is is only an imperfect preliminary version. It has to be reviewed by external contributors to be improved. By making our standard public, we hope it will gain visibility, and **attract as much feedback as possible**. We would love to learn:
-   how often can the standard be used?
-   in which cases is the standard not adapted?
-   what is missing in the standard?
